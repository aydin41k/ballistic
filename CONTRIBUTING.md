## How to Contribute

### Finding Something to Work On

- **Browse the issues**: Check the [Issues](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ballistic/issues) tab for open issues
- **Look for "good first issue" labels**: These are great for beginners
- **Create a new issue**: If you've found a bug or have a feature idea, create an issue to discuss it first

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name
   ```
   Use descriptive branch names like `feature/add-dark-mode` or `fix/drag-drop-bug`

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add comments where necessary
   - Keep commits focused and atomic

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   ./runtests.sh
   ```
   Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

4. **Write tests for new features**
   - Add tests in the `src/__tests__/` directory
   - Follow the existing test patterns
   - Ensure your new feature has adequate test coverage

5. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `test:` for adding or updating tests
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `style:` for formatting changes
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

6. **Keep your fork up to date**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
